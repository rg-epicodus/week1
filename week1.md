# My day of the Chickens

### April 22nd, 2017

Our day started out great, we got up at 0530 and let the chickens out. They usually rush out of the coop into the enclosure and go for some water and food. After a few minutes they will start to wander out and peck around the ground for more food.

We then started making our coffee. We use a [Bialetti Mocha Express 6 cup](https://www.amazon.com/Bialetti-6-Cup-Stovetop-Espresso-Maker/dp/B000CNY6UK) coffee maker. It takes a bit of time but makes great espresso. I will heat up some milk on the stove and then when the coffee is done I will add it to the sugar that has been prepared in a sup. After that is infused, the coffee is added to the milk on the stove, and then a bit of home made vanilla extract is put in. Some call this a latte but I think it is supposed to be called Cafe au Lait. Whatever it is called, it is good and beats any coffee shop _hands down_.

After our coffee today, my partner started to clean up our teenager's room, since it has been years since the floor was visible. Our littlest one, who loves to help, tried to participate as much as possible. Her reward was the pennies that were left on the floor.

Looking outside I can see our chickens running around searching for some thing to eat. We have eight hens. Two of them are [Brown Novogen] [1] three of them are [Ameraucana] [2] followed up by a [Delaware] [3] a [Black Laced Wyandotte] [4] and one [Buff Orpington] [5].

Our Epicodus homework this week was to make a blog post about something and use a few markdown formats that were not covered in class or previous homework, as I understand. So the formats I have decided to include in this homework and using 3 characters such as "\*" or "-" three times in a row on their own line to create a **horizontal rule**.

I have also included the use of **Span Elements**, "my reference links", after a paragraph to make the ease of creating a content of a post in markdown easier and more aesthetically pleasing when viewing.
